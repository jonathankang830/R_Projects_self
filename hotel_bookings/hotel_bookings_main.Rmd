```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

The main R file for analyzing hotel_bookings dataset
In this project we will be investigating about questions regarding about the cheapest time to travel

```{r read dataset and import libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

hotel_bookings <- read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/jonathankang830/R_Projects_self/hotel_bookings/hotel_bookings.csv")
str(hotel_bookings)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
